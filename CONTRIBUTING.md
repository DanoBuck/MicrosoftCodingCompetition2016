# How to contribute

* Choose a problem statement under /problem_statements
* Code a solution in the coding language of your choice
* Test and add this solution to the right folder (each folder is a coding language)
* If you coded a solution in a coding language not available on the Repository, just create a new folder

## Rules

Naming convention:
Each solution should be named [PROBLEM NAME]_[YOUR NAME].[EXTENSION]

Coding best practice:
Solutions to problems using an expected "input" should use "input.txt" as the default name for this file
Solutions to problems should either print to the console the output (that can be later on piped into an output file), or create a file called ""
